# Todo Components

This example shows a Todo MVC application built with internal components for each Todo Item.

To run the example, run

```shell
yarn build:watch
```

then open

- `http://localhost:5173/` for the regular version.
- `http://localhost:5173/secure` for the secure version, at which both the Todo and Todo Item run in a sandbox
- `http://localhost:5173/__inspect/` to view the transformations.
