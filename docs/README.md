# Jay Framework Documentation

Welcome to the Jay framework documentation! Jay is an experimental framework that solves the design-to-code challenge by creating contracts between design tools and headless components.

## What is Jay?

Jay enables you to:

- **Create contracts** between design tools and components
- **Build headless components** that work with any UI design
- **Support both client-only and full-stack** setups
- **Use headfull and headless components** for maximum flexibility
- **Manage reactive state** with built-in signals
- **Ensure zero-trust security** with secure serialization
- **Maintain type safety** throughout your application

## Quick Start

1. **Install Jay** - Get started with the framework
2. **Create your first component** - Build a simple counter
3. **Learn the core concepts** - Understand Jay's philosophy
4. **Explore examples** - See real-world patterns

## Key Features

### Contract-First Design

Jay uses contracts to define the interface between design tools and components. This enables:

- **Design tool integration** - Connect Figma, Sketch, or other design tools
- **Component reusability** - Use the same component with different designs
- **Type safety** - Automatic TypeScript generation from contracts

### Reactive State Management

Built-in reactive primitives for state management:

- **Signals** - Fine-grained reactivity
- **Computed values** - Derived state
- **Effects** - Side effects and lifecycle management

### Zero-Trust Security

Secure by default with:

- **Immutable data** - Prevents accidental mutations
- **Secure serialization** - Safe data transfer between server and client
- **Type validation** - Runtime type checking

### Full-Stack Support

Support for both client-only and full-stack applications:

- **Client components** - Traditional SPA components
- **Full-stack components** - Server-side rendering with client interactivity
- **Three-phase rendering** - Optimized for performance

## Getting Help
