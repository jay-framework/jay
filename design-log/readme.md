# Design Log

The design log is a way to capture design decisions as they happen, and log the thought process and decisions.

The design log is not a documentation.

The design log is not updated after the fact - the documents are up-to-date to the time of their writing.
If latter discussion changes the decision of a document, it is not updated.

Still, the design log gives a lot of context to the why and how things work in Jay.
